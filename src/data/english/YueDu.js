  One day Peter told Bill, "I'd like to give a party on Saturday, I'd like you to come and bring Martha, too.""Thanks, Peter. We'd be happy to come.""Perhaps you'd like to bring your violin. You and Martha sing well together. I'm sure everyone will want you to sing for us."That was how Peter began to plan his party. Next he asked another friend, Betty, to bring a cake."You make the best cake in the world, Betty, and I like to eat your cake better than have one from the bakery."Peter invited a few other friends to come to his party. He didn't forget to ask something from each one of them. He even asked Jim and Mary Jackson to let him give the party at their house! They agreed. 
  The party was a big success. However, as the guests were leaving, they said"Thank you "to Bill and Martha for the music, Betty for the cake, the Jacksons for the use of the house and to others for their hard work. To Peter they just said,"Thanks for the invitation."`,

    text: `How men first learnt to invent words is unknown; in other words, the origin of language is a mystery. All we really know is that men, unlike animals, somehow invented certain sounds to express thought and feelings, actions and things, so that they could communicate with each other; and that later they agreed upon certain signs, called letters, which could be combined to present those sounds, and which could be written down. Those sounds, whether spoken or written in letters, we call words.
  The power of words, then, lies in their associations - the things they bring up before our minds. Words become filled with meaning for us by experience; and the longer we live, the more certain words recall to us the glad and sad events of our past; and the more we read and learn, the more the number of words that mean something increases.
  Great writers are those who not only have great thoughts but also express these thoughts in words which appeal powerfully to our minds and emotions. This charming and telling use of words is what we call literary style. Above all, the real poet is a master of words. He can convey his meaning in words which sing like music and which by their position and association can move men to tears. We should therefore learn to choose our words carefully and use them accurately, or they will make our speech silly and vulgar.  `,

    text: `When you take a walk in many of the cities in the West, you often see a lot of people walking dogs. It is still true that a dog is the most useful and faithful animal in the world. But the reasons why people keep a dog have changed.
  In the old days, people used to train dogs to protect themselves against attacks by other beasts. And later, they came to realize that the dog was not only useful for protection but willing to obey his master. For example, when people used dogs for hunting, the dogs would not eat what was caught without permission. But now, people in the city need not protect themselves against attacks of an animal.
  Why do they keep dogs, then? Some people keep dogs to protect themselves from robbery, but the most important reason is for companionship. For a child, a dog is his best friend when he has no friends to play with. For young couples, a dog is their child when they have no children. For old couples, a dog is also their child when their real children have grown up. So the main reason why people keep dogs has changed from protection to friendship.`,

  We learn our own language by hearing people speak it, not by seeing what they write. We imitate what we hear. In school, though you learn to read and write as well as to hear and speak, it is best to learn all the new words through the ear. You can read them, spell them and write them later. `,

  Energy from the sun heats the earth's surface. The earth would be too cold for life without our star's heat energy. Other stars are too far away to give the earth enough heat energy for life. Scientists wonder if there is life near other stars.
  Our sun is an average(平均的) size star. It appears like the largest one, because it is the closest star. Some stars are smaller than our sun. Very small stars are called dwarf(短小的)stars. Some of them are no larger than our small planets. Some stars are much larger than our sun. The largest stars are called giant(巨大的)stars. 
  Not all stars are the same distance from the earth. The different distances make some giant stars appear very small. Astronomers (天文学家)use light-year to talk about distance in space. A light-year is the distance the light travels in one year. The star, Alpha Centauri is the closest star besides our sun. It is over 4 light-year away from earth. It takes light from this star over four years to reach the earth.`,

  Throughout the world, every night children and their elders are "talking" online ─ many of them are talking at the same time.
  It's fast: trying talking to six people once. It's convenient: three or four words per exchange. It takes cleverness, concentration and quick fingers.
  And it requires very simple language. There's neither time nor space for explanations. Why waste precious time telling six friends you have to leave for a moment to take care of your little brother when BRB (=be right back) will do?
  Want to enter a conversation? Just type PMFJI (=pardon me for jumping in).
  Interested in whom you're talking to? Type A/S/L, the common request to know your pal's age, sex and location. You may get 15/M/NY as a reply from your pal. 
  If something makes you laugh, say you're OTF (=on the floor), or LOL (=laughing out loud), or join the two into ROTFL (=rolling on the floor laughing).
  And when it's time to get back to work or go to bed, you type GTG (=got to go) or TTYL (=talk to you later).
  People want to write as fast as possible, and they want to get their ideas across as quickly as they can. Capital letters are left in the dust, except when expressing feeling, as it takes more time to hold down the "shift" key and use capitals. Punctuation is going too.`,

  You probably know how to ride a bike safely. Now learn to use a computer safely. 
  Your eyes 
  Too much light can injure your eyes, so never sit too close to a computer screen. Your eyes should be at least 50cm from the screen. Remember to look away from it sometimes. This gives your eyes a rest. 
  When you use a computer, the window should be on your left or your right. If it is behind you, the light will reflect on (反射) the screen. If the window is in front of you, the sun and the screen will both shine into your eyes. 
  Your hands and wrists 
  Hand and wrist injuries can happen because the hands and wrists are moved in the same way hundreds of times. If you use a keyboard for a long time, follow these three rules:1) Rest your wrists on some thing. 2) Keep your elbows (肘) at the same height as the keyboard. 3) Stop sometimes and exercise your hands, wrists and fingers in a different way. 
  Your back 
  Some people sit for many hours in front of a computer. If you sit in the wrong way, you can injure your back or your neck. So you should sit with your back straight. The top part of the screen should be in front of your eyes. Your forearms, wrists, hands and the upper part of your legs should all be parallel (平行) to the floor. If you are sitting for a long time, get up every 30 minutes and exercise your arms, legs and neck.

  What kinds of people rent their home furnishings instead of buying them? People who are international business or government officials, foreign students, airline workers, young married couples - people whose job or business may force them to move frequently from one city to another. They save a lot of trouble and the cost of moving their furniture each time. They simply rent new furniture when they reach their new homes. Young people with little money do not want to buy cheap furniture that they may soon dislike. They prefer to wait until they have enough money to buy furniture they really like. Meanwhile, they find they can rent better quality furniture than they could afford to buy.
  One family, who now have a large, beautiful home of their own, liked their rented furniture so much that they decided to keep renting it instead of buying new things.

First a willow tree attacked in the woods by caterpillars (毛虫) changed the chemistry of its leaves and made them taste so terrible that they got tired of the leaves and stopped eating them. Then even more astonishing, the tree sent out a special smell--a signal causing its neighbors to change the chemistry of their own leaves and make them less tasty.
  Communication, of course, doesn't need to be in words. We can talk to each other by smiling, raising our shoulders and moving our hands.

  It all began a year ago when Albert returned home one evening and found a large dog in front of his gate. He was very fond of animals and as he happened to have a small piece of chocolate in his pocket, he gave it to the dog. The next day, the dog was there again. It held up its paws and received another piece of chocolate as a reward. Albert called his new friend "Bingo". He never found out the dog's real name, nor who his owner was. However, Bingo appeared regularly every afternoon and it was quite clear that he preferred chocolate to bones. He soon grew dissatisfied with small pieces of chocolate and demanded a large bar a day. If at any time Albert neglected his duty, Bingo got very angry and refused to let him open the gate. Albert was now at Bingo's mercy and had to bribe him to get into his own house! He spent such a large part of his weekly wages to keep Bingo supplied with that in the end he had to move somewhere else. `,

You soon become lost in some books or other, and usually it is only much later that you realize you have spent far too much time there and must hurry to keep some forgotten appointment --- without buying a book, of course.

  Of course, scientists cannot answer all of our questions. If we ask, "Why is the ocean full of salt?" scientists will say that the salt comes from rocks. When a rock gets very hot or very cold, it cracks. Rain falls into the cracks. The rain then carries the salt into the earth and into the rivers. The rivers carry the salt into the ocean.

  J. M. Tanner has been measuring people from all over the world for a long time. He has also studied people's growth records of the past 100 years. 
  "Children today are bigger than ever before," he says. "Today's nine-year-olds look like eleven-year-olds looked back in 1900." 
  According to Tanner, adults are also taller than ever before. 
  But the biggest change can be seen in young people. That's because boys used to keep on growing until they reached age 26. But today they stop growing at 18 or 19. Most girls stop growing even earlier. So today's teenagers are bigger than 26-year-olds were 60 years ago. 
  What is causing this change? Professor Tanner says it's proper food. Good food alone cannot make you grow beyond your natural limits. Your final height is partly caused by the height of your parents and grandparents. But eating proper food can help you reach your final height, and reach it early in life. 
  Will people keep on getting bigger? Will we have a race of giants? No - at least not if the US is an example. Tanner says that we have eaten proper food for years, and our growth rate has already begun to level off. `,

    text: `In ancient time the most important examinations were spoken, not written. In the schools of ancient Greece and Rome, testing usually consisted of saying poetry aloud or giving speeches.
  In the European universities of the Middle Ages, students who were working for advanced degrees had to discuss questions in their field of study with people who had made a special study of the subject. This custom exists today as part of the process of testing candidates for the doctor's degree.
  Generally, however, modern examinations are written. The written examination, where all students are tested on the same questions, was probably not known until the nineteenth century. Perhaps it came into existence with the great increase in population and the development of modern industry. A room full of candidates for a state examination, timed exactly by electric clocks and carefully watched over by managers, resembles a group of workers at an automobile factory. Certainly, during examinations teachers and students are expected to act like machines.`,

He cried, "Help! Help!" One of his friends held out his hand and said, "Give me your hand and I will pull you out." The landlord's head went under the water and then came up again, but he did not give his hand to his friends. Then another of his friends tried but the same thing happened.
  Just then a farmer came over and saw all this. He knew the landlord very well. He said to the others, "Let me try." He held out his hand and said to the landlord, "Take my hand and I will pull you out." Hearing this, the landlord took the farmer's hand, and in a minute the farmer pulled the landlord out of the water.

    text: `A farmer had once made a purchase of a fine fat sheep, hoping to offer it up to the Buddha. While he was leading it home, four thieves saw him and made up their minds to steal the sheep. They knew him to be an honest person and one who thought of no more harm in others than he had in himself. They dared not take the sheep away from him  by force, for they were too near the city. Therefore, they thought hard and got an idea: they first parted company and then came to the man as if they had come from several distinct parts.
  The first thief came up to the farm and said, "My good old man, why are you leading this dog?"
  At this moment the second thief, coming from another direction, cried to him, "Poor old man, where have you stolen this dog?"And immediately after these words, the third thief came up and asked the farmer,"Where are you going with this handsome greyhound?"
  The poor farmer began to doubt whether the sheep was a sheep or not. But the fourth robber put him quite beside himself by coming near him and asking what the dog cost him.
  The farmer began to think and got the conclusion that the four men, who came from different directions, could not all be wrong. He believed that the sheep he was leading was a dog. On realizing this, the farmer went back quickly to the market to demand his money from the person who sold him the dog, leaving the dog with the four thieves.`,

    text: `The fourth Thursday in November is called Thanksgiving Day. In the United States, it is an annual occasion to show thanks to God for his goodness.
  As a historical, national and religious holiday, Thanksgiving Day began with the English in Plymouth Colony. As far back as 1621, after a long bitter winter and the gathering of the first harvest, these early settlers shared a feast with the local Indians and offered prayers of thanksgiving. The first national Thanksgiving Day was proclaimed(颁布) by President Washington on November 26, 1789. President Lincoln revived the custom in 1863.
  It was not until 1941 that the U.S. Congress adopted a resolution(决定), setting the fourth Thursday of November as an annual Thanksgiving Day. Thus what began as a religious celebration of the harvest has since become a nationwide holiday.
  Now Thanksgiving Day is usually a family day, celebrated with a traditional turkey dinner and a happy reunion. Schools are closed on Thanksgiving Day and the day after. Many people, including students studying in another state, often travel long distances to spend the holiday at home.`,

    text: `In the United States, it is not customary to telephone someone very early in the morning. If you telephone him early in the day, while he is shaving or having breakfast, the time of the call shows that the matter is very important and requires immediate attention. The same meaning is attached to telephone calls made after 11:00 pm. If someone receives a call during sleeping hours, he assumes it's a matter of life or death. The time chosen for the call communicates its importance.
  In social life, time plays a very important part. In the U.S.A. guests tend to feel they are not highly regarded if the invitation to a dinner party is extended only three or four days before the party date. But it is not true in all countries. In other areas of the world, it may be considered foolish to make an appointment too far in advance because plans which are made for a date more than a week away tend to be forgotten. The meaning of time differs in different parts of the world. Thus, misunderstandings arise between people from different cultures that treat time differently. Promptness is valued highly in American life, for example. If people are not prompt, they may be regarded as impolite or not fully responsible. In the U.S. no one would think of keeping a business associate waiting for an hour, it would be too impolite. A person, who is 5 minutes late, will say a few words of explanation, though perhaps he will not complete the sentence.`,

  "And why do you want to do that?" the FC asked sharply. Again, Robert almost lost his temper. "Because more and more people are listening to my department's programmes. There's great demand for them,"he answered.
  The FC did not seem to believe him. But Robert had a report on the numbers of listeners to all EBC programmes. The FC became less confident. Robert threw the report down on the table and told him to read it.
  The FC looked at it in silence. The figures proved that he had been wrong, but he did not want to admit it. "Well," he finally said, "I may have made a small mistake." Robert noticed the word "may."He got up to leave. But he had the feeling that he would get the money after all.`,

    text: `Chess must be one of the oldest games in the world. An Arab traveller in India in the year 900 wrote that it was played 'long, long ago.' Chess was probably invented in India, and it has been played everywhere from Japan to Europe since 1400. The name 'chess' is interesting. When one player is attacking the other's king, he says in English, 'check'. When the king has been caught and cannot move anywhere, he says 'check mate'. These words come from Persian 'Shah mat' means 'the king is dead'. That is when the game is over, and one player has won.
  Such an old game changes very slowly. The rules have not always been the same as they are now. For example, at one time the queen could only move one square at a time. Now she is the strongest piece on the board. It would be interesting to know why this has happened. Chess takes time and thought, but it is a game for all kinds of people. You don't have to be a champion in order to enjoy it. It is not always played by two people sitting at the same table. The first time the Americans beat the Russians was in a match played by radio. Some of the chess masters are able to play many people at the same time. The record was when one man played 400 games! It is said that some people played chess by post. This must make chess the slowest game in the world.`,

    text: `A characteristic of American culture that has become almost a tradition is to respect the self-made man - the man who has risen to the top through his own efforts, usually beginning by working with his hands. While the leader in business or industry or the college professor occupies a higher social position and commands greater respect in the community than the common laborer or even the skilled factory worker, he may take pains to point out that his father started life in America as a farmer or laborer of some sort.
  This attitude toward manual (体力的) labor is now still seen in many aspects of American life. One is invited to dinner at a home that is not only comfortably but even luxuriously (豪华地) furnished and in which there is every evidence of the fact that the family has been able to afford foreign travel, expensive hobbies, and college education for the children; yet the hostess probably will cook the dinner herself, will serve it herself and will wash dishes afterward; furthermore,  the dinner will not consist merely of something quickly and easily assembled from contents of various cans and a cake or a pie bought at the nearby bakery. On the contrary, the hostess usually takes pride in careful preparation of special dishes. A professional may talk about washing the car, digging in his flowerbeds, painting the house. His wife may even help with these things, just as he often helps her with the dishwashing. The son who is away at college may wait on table and wash dishes for his living, or during the summer he may work with a construction gang on a highway in order to pay for his education. `,

    text: `Who will stage the games?
  Preparing for the Olympic Games is a huge undertaking (工程). Just like the athletes, the host city spends years getting ready for the event. Before deciding which city will host the Olympic Games, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has to examine bids from all over the world. Bidding for the games begins about ten years in advance. Without preparing a very strong bid, a city will not win the competition to host the games. Beijing was chosen for the 2008 games from five bidders 一 Osaka, Paris, Toronto and Istanbul.
  
  Why does it take so long to prepare? 
  Building the infrastructure (基础设施) costs huge amounts of money. Holding the World Cup in 2002 in Japan and South Korea, for example, meant that ten new stadiums had to be built, as well as many hotels and an improved transport system. In Beijing, after winning the bid the government began major construction projects 一 the extension of the underground, the improvement of the airport and the building of new motorways. Each host city must also build an Olympic village for the athletes. By planting trees and creating parks, the city becomes more attractive for tourists.
  
  Why do countries want to host the Olympic Games?
  Hosting the games has a major effect on the economy and brings international prestige(声望) to the country. Thousands and thousands of visitors come to the games and the host cities are permanently improved.

  In some cities the rubbish is collected and taken outside the city to a dump. Often the city dump is placed where the ground is low or there is a big hole. The kitchen rubbish is broken into small pieces and sent into the sewage(污水,排水)system. The sewage system takes away the used water from toilets, bathtubs and other places.
  To keep mice and flies away, some earth is used to cover the newly dumped rubbish. Later, grass may be planted on the rubbish-filled land. Finally, a house or a school may be built there, and then you'd never know that this had once been an old rubbish dump.
  In other cities the rubbish is burnt in special places. The fire burns everything except the metal.Sometimes the metal can be used again in factories where things are made of metal.

  2. A destructive word to someone who is down can be what it takes to kill him.
