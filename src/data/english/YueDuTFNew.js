    text: `A foreigner's first impression of the U.S. is likely to be that everyone is in a rush-often under pressure. City people appear always to be hurrying to get where they are going restlessly, seeking attention in a store, and elbowing others as they try to complete their errands (任务). Racing through daytime meals is part of the pace of life in this country.
Working time is considered precious. Others in public eating places are waiting for you to finish so that they too can be served and get back to work within the time allowed. Each person hurries to make room for the next person. If you don't, waiters will hurry you.
You also find drivers will be abrupt and that people will push past you. You will miss smiles, brief conversations, and small courtesies with strangers. Don't take it personally. This is because people value time highly, and they resent someone else "wasting" it beyond a certain courtesy point.
      The view of time affects the importance we attach to patience. In the American system of values, patience is not a high priority. Many of us have what might be called "a short fuse." We begin to move restlessly about if we feel time is slipping away without some returnbe this in terms of pleasure, work value, or rest. Those coming from lands where time is looked upon differently may find this matter of pace to be one of their most difficult adjustments in both business and daily life.
Many newcomers to the States will miss the opening courtesy of a business call, for example, they will miss the ritual socializing that goes with a welcoming cup of tea or coffee they may be traditional in their own country. They may miss leisurely business chats in a café or coffeehouse. Normally, Americans do not assess their visitors in such relaxed surroundings over prolonged small talks. We seek out evidence of past performance rather than evaluate a business colleague through social courtesies. Since we generally assess and probe professionally rather than socially, we start talking business very quickly. (348 words)

    It ran here and there looking for some water but could not find any.
    Then suddenly, when the ant was almost ready to die of thirst, a large drop of water fell on it.
    The ant drank the water, which saved its life.
    The water was actually a tear from a young girl who was crying. Because of her sadness, the tear had magical qualities and suddenly the ant could speak the language of human beings.
    The ant looked up and saw the young girl sitting in front of a huge pile of seeds.
    "Why are you sad?" asked the ant.
    "I'm the prisoner of a giant." the girl told the ant. "He won't let me go until I've made three separate heaps of grain, barley(大麦)and rye(黑麦)out of this huge pile of seeds in which they are all mixed together."
    "That will take you a month!" the ant said, looking at the huge pile of seeds.
    "I know," the girl cried, "and if I haven't finished by tomorrow, the giant will eat me for his supper!"
    "Don't cry," the ant said, "my friends and I will help you."
    Soon thousands of ants were at work, separating the three kinds of seeds.
    The next morning, when the giant saw that the work had been done, he let the girl go. 
    Thus it was one of her tears that saved her life. `,

The sick person falls into a kind of sleep, and when he awakes, the operation is finished. But these happy conditions are fairly new. It is not many years since a man who had to have operation felt all in its pain.
Long ago, operation has usually to be done while the sick man could feel everything. Sooner after 1770, Joseph Priestley discovered a gas which is now called "laughing gas". Laughing as became known in America. Young men and women went to parties to try it. Most of them spent their time laughing, but one man at a party, Horace Wells, noticed that people didn't seem to feel pain when they were using this gas. He decided to make an experiment on himself. He asked a friend to help him.
Wells took some of the gas, and his friend pulled out one of Well's teeth. Wells felt no pain at all. 
As he didn't know enough about laughing gas, he gave a man less gas than he should have. The man cried out with pain when his tooth was being pulled out.
Wells tried again, but this time he gave too much of the gas, and the man died. Wells never forgot this terrible event.

    text: `The undersea world is very beautiful. Now more and more people want to dive in the water to find the secrets there. Scuba(戴水肺) diving is a new sport today. It can take you into a wonderful undersea world.
You will find many strange animals in the sea. Some are like a school bus. Many sea animals give out light in the dark and some have sharp teeth.
During the day, there is enough light. Here, under the sea, everything is blue and green. When fish swim nearby, you can catch them, with your hands. When you have bottles of air on your back, you can stay in deep water for a long time. However, you can't dive too deep. And you must be very careful when you dive in deep water. 
The deep sea is not an easy place to live in. It is cold, and it is dark, too. The deeper it is, the less sunlight there is. About 3000 feet, there is no light at all. It is very dark in the sea. Many fishes have no eyes. Some have big eyes. A few have eyes on one side. 
Besides, the coldness and the darkness, deep-sea animals face a third danger-other animals.
Animals eat! They must find food to eat. Many animals eat plants. However, some animals eat meat. This means these sea animals have two big jobs. They need to find animals as food, and they have to try not to become other animal's meal.`,

    text: `Three man traveling on a train began a conversation about the world's greatest wonders.
"In my opinion," the first man said, "the Egyptian pyramids" are the world's greatest wonder. Although they were built thousands of years ago, they are still standing. And remember: the people who built them had only simple tools. They did not have the kind of machinery that builders and engineers have today."
" I agree that the pyramids in Egypt are wonderful," the second man said," But I don't think they are the greatest wonder. I believe computers are more wonderful than the pyramids. They are taken people to the moon and brought them back safely. In seconds, they carry out mathematical calculations that would take a person a hundred years to do."
He turned to the third man and asked, "What do you think is the greatest wonder in world?"
The third man thought for a long time, and then he said, "Well, I agree that the pyramids are wonderful, and I agree that computers are wonderful, too. However, in my opinion, the most wonderful thing in the world is this thermos."
And he took a thermos out of his bag and held it up.
The other two men were very surprised. "A thermos?" they exclaimed. "But that's a simple thing."
"Oh, no, it's not," the third man said. "In the winter you put in a hot drink and it says hot. In the summer you put in a cold drink and it stays cold. How does the thermos know whether it's winter or summer?"
