Computers can injure you. Most other injuries happen suddenly. For example,if you fall off a bike and break your arms,it happens very quickly. But computer injuries happen slowly. 
You probably know how to ride a bike safely. Now learn to use a computer safely. 
Your eyes 
Too much light can injure your eyes,so never sit too close to a computer screen. Your eyes should be at least 50cm from the screen. Remember to look away from it sometimes. This gives your eyes a rest. 
When you use a computer, the window should be on your left or your right. If it is behind you, the light will reflect on (反射) the screen. If the window is in front of you, the sun and the screen will both shine into your eyes. 
Your hands and wrists 
Hand and wrist injuries can happen because the hands and wrists are moved in the same way hundreds of times. If you use a keyboard for a long time,follow these three rules:1) Rest your wrists on some thing. 2) Keep your elbows (肘) at the same height as the keyboard. 3) Stop sometimes and exercise your hands,wrists and fingers in a different way. 
Your back 
Some people sit for many hours in front of a computer. If you sit in the wrong way,you can injure your back or your neck. So you should sit with your back straight. The top part of the screen should be in front of your eyes. Your forearms,wrists,hands and the upper part of your legs should all be parallel (平行) to the floor. If you are sitting for a long time,get up every 30 minutes and exercise your arms,legs and neck. 
Enjoy your computer,but use it safely.

答案：B
In the United States, it is not customary to telephone someone very early in the morning. If you telephone him early in the day, while he is shaving or having breakfast, the time of the call shows that the matter is very important and requires immediate attention. The same meaning is attached to telephone calls made after 11:00 pm. If someone receives a call during sleeping hours, he assumes it's a matter of life or death. The time chosen for the call communicates its importance.
In social life, time plays a very important part. In the U.S.A. guests tend to feel they are not highly regarded if the invitation to a dinner party is extended only three or four days before the party date. But it is not true in all countries. In other areas of the world, it may be considered foolish to make an appointment too far in advance because plans which are made for a date more than a week away tend to be forgotten. The meaning of time differs in different parts of the world. Thus, misunderstandings arise between people from different cultures that treat time differently. Promptness is valued highly in American life, for example. If people are not prompt, they may be regarded as impolite or not fully responsible. In the U.S. no one would think of keeping a business associate waiting for an hour, it would be too impolite. A person, who is 5 minutes late, will say a few words of explanation, though perhaps he will not complete the sentence.
