Those sounds, whether spoken or written in letters, we call words.\n  The power of words, then, lies in their associations - the things they bring up before our minds. Words become filled with meaning for us by experience; and the longer we live, the more certain words recall to us the glad and sad events of our past; and the more we read and learn, the more the number of words that mean something increases.\n  Great writers are those who not only have great thoughts but also express these thoughts in words which appeal powerfully to our minds and emotions. This charming and telling use of words is what we call literary style. Above all, the real poet is a master of words. He can convey his meaning in words which sing like music and which by their position and association can move men to tears.

But eating proper food can help you reach your final height, and reach it early in life. \n  Will people keep on getting bigger? Will we have a race of giants?

President Lincoln revived the custom in 1863.\n  It was not until 1941 that the U.S. Congress adopted a resolution(决定), setting the fourth Thursday of November as an annual Thanksgiving Day.

The time chosen for the call communicates its importance.\n  In social life, time plays a very important part. In the U.S.A. guests tend to feel they are not highly regarded if the invitation to a dinner party is extended only three or four days before the party date. But it is not true in all countries. In other areas of the world, it may be considered foolish to make an appointment too far in advance because plans which are made for a date more than a week away tend to be forgotten. The meaning of time differs in different parts of the world. Thus, misunderstandings arise between people from different cultures that treat time differently. Promptness is valued highly in American life, for example. If people are not prompt, they may be regarded as impolite or not fully responsible. In the U.S. no one would think of keeping a business associate waiting for an hour, it would be too impolite.

Just like the athletes, the host city spends years getting ready for the event. Before deciding which city will host the Olympic Games, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has to examine bids from all over the world. Bidding for the games begins about ten years in advance. Without preparing a very strong bid, a city will not win the competition to host the games. Beijing was chosen for the 2008 games from five bidders 一 Osaka, Paris, Toronto and Istanbul.\n  \n  Why does it take so long to prepare? \n  Building the infrastructure (基础设施) costs huge amounts of money. Holding the World Cup in 2002 in Japan and South Korea, for example, meant that ten new stadiums had to be built, as well as many hotels and an improved transport system. In Beijing, after winning the bid the government began major construction projects 一 the extension of the underground, the improvement of the airport and the building of new motorways. Each host city must also build an Olympic village for the athletes. By planting trees and creating parks, the city becomes more attractive for tourists.\n  \n  Why do countries want to host the Olympic Games?\n  Hosting the games has a major effect on the economy and brings international prestige(声望) to the country. Thousands and thousands of visitors come to the games and the host cities are permanently improved.  \n  `,\n    questions: [\n      {\n        question: `Bidding for the Olympic Games usually starts one year before the games are really held.`,\n        options: [\"T\", \"F\"],\n        answer: \"B\"\n      },\n      {\n        question: `Beijing was one of the five bidders for the 2008 games.`,\n        options: [\"T\", \"F\"],\n        answer: \"A\"\n      },\n      {\n        question: `The World Cup 2002 was held in China.`,\n        options: [\"T\", \"F\"],\n        answer: \"B\"\n      },\n      {\n        question: `Beijing started the improvement of the airport after winning the bid.`,\n        options: [\"T\", \"F\"],\n        answer: \"A\"\n      },\n      {\n        question: `Countries want to host the Olympic Games because it has a major effect on the economy.`,\n        options: [\"T\", \"F\"],\n        answer: \"A\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    text: `Taking away a city's rubbish is a big job. Every day trucks come into a city to collect it. Most rubbish is made up of things we can't eat or use. If we kept these things, we would soon have a mountain of rubbish.\n  In some cities the rubbish is collected and taken outside the city to a dump. Often the city dump is placed where the ground is low or there is a big hole. The kitchen rubbish is broken into small pieces and sent into the sewage(污水,排水)system. The sewage system takes away the used water from toilets, bathtubs and other places.\n  To keep mice and flies away, some earth is used to cover the newly dumped rubbish. Later, grass may be planted on the rubbish-filled land. Finally, a house or a school may be built there, and then you'd never know that this had once been an old rubbish dump.\n  In other cities the rubbish is burnt in special places. The fire burns everything except the metal.Sometimes the metal can be used again in factories where things are made of metal. The food parts of rubbish are put in special piles where they slowly change into something called humus(腐殖质), which looks like black earth. It is rich with the kinds of things that feed plants and help make them grow. `,\n    questions: [\n      {\n        question: `You can most probably read this kind of passage in a telephone book.`,\n        options: [\"T\", \"F\"],\n        answer: \"B\"\n      },\n      {\n        question: `The main idea of the passage is to tell people to take useful things out of rubbish.`,\n        options: [\"T\", \"F\"],\n        answer: \"B\"\n      },\n      {\n        question: `The underlined word \"sewage\" in the second paragraph means laundry.`,\n        options: [\"T\", \"F\"],\n        answer: \"B\"\n      },\n      {\n        question: `According to the passage, the food parts of rubbish can be used again to feed plants.`,\n        options: [\"T\", \"F\"],\n        answer: \"A\"\n      },\n      {\n        question: `We should take care of a used metal box by reusing and recycling it.`,\n        options: [\"T\", \"F\"],\n        answer: \"A\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    text: `A group of frogs were traveling through the woods, and two of them fell into a deep pit.

The other frogs kept telling them to stop, that they were as good as dead. Finally, one of the frogs took heed of(倾听) what the other frogs were saying and gave up. He fell down and died.\n  The other frog continued to jump as hard as he could. Once again, the crowd of frogs shouted  at him to stop the pain and just die.

A destructive word to someone who is down can be what it takes to kill him.\n  Be careful of what you say.
