Those sounds, whether spoken or written in letters, we call words.\n  The power of words, then, lies in their associations - the things they bring up before our minds. Words become filled with meaning for us by experience; and the longer we live, the more certain words recall to us the glad and sad events of our past; and the more we read and learn, the more the number of words that mean something increases.\n  Great writers are those who not only have great thoughts but also express these thoughts in words which appeal powerfully to our minds and emotions. This charming and telling use of words is what we call literary style. Above all, the real poet is a master of words. He can convey his meaning in words which sing like music and which by their position and association can move men to tears.

Young people with little money do not want to buy cheap furniture that they may soon dislike. They prefer to wait until they have enough money to buy furniture they really like. Meanwhile, they find they can rent better quality furniture than they could afford to buy.\n  One family, who now have a large, beautiful home of their own, liked their rented furniture so much that they decided to keep renting it instead of buying new things. But usually people don't like to tell others about it. The idea of renting home furnishings is still quite new, and they are not sure what their neighbors might think. `,\n    questions: [\n      {\n        question: `Which of the following has become one of America’s fastest growing businesses? `,\n        options: [\n          \"Selling home furnishings.\",\n          \"Renting furnished apartments.\",\n          \"Selling used furniture.\",\n          \"Renting home furnishings.\"\n        ],\n        answer: \"D\"\n      },\n      {\n        question: `Why do some people prefer to rent furniture?`,\n        options: [\n          \"Because the furniture they get in this way is new.\",\n          \"Because it saves them a lot of money.\",\n          \"Because it saves them much trouble and money.\",\n          \"Because they can always get better quality furniture in this way.\"\n        ],\n        answer: \"C\"\n      },\n      {\n        question: `What can you infer from the passage?`,\n        options: [\n          \"The idea of renting furniture is not acceptable.\",\n          \"Renting furniture is not popular in the couple’s home town.\",\n          \"Only those who don’t have enough money to rent furniture.\",\n          \"People usually grow to like the furniture they have rented.\"\n        ],\n        answer: \"B\"\n      },\n      {\n        question: `Which of the following can best serve as the title of the passage?`,\n        options: [\n          \"Rent or Buy?\",\n          \"A New Way of Getting Home Furnishings.\",\n          \"Furnished Apartments.\",\n          \"A New Idea.\"\n        ],\n        answer: \"B\"\n      },\n      {\n        question: `Young people liked renting home furniture because_________.`,\n        options: [\n          \"they have less money\",\n          \"they don’t want to buy old furniture\",\n          \"the new furniture is of good quality\",\n          \"they don’t have much money and don’t want to buy the cheap furniture\"\n        ],\n        answer: \"D\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    text: `Elvis Aron Presley, often called \"the king of rock music\", died on August 16th, 1977, at the age of forty-two.

While most of these fans knew a lot about the songs of Elvis, few of them knew the story of how Elvis had his first record which was for his mother.

Sam Philips, who owned the shop where Elvis made the record, liked Presley's songs. He said he would call him some day. About a year later, Philips did call and asked him to cut a record.

But eating proper food can help you reach your final height, and reach it early in life. \n  Will people keep on getting bigger? Will we have a race of giants?

President Lincoln revived the custom in 1863.\n  It was not until 1941 that the U.S. Congress adopted a resolution(决定), setting the fourth Thursday of November as an annual Thanksgiving Day.

The time chosen for the call communicates its importance.\n  In social life, time plays a very important part. In the U.S.A. guests tend to feel they are not highly regarded if the invitation to a dinner party is extended only three or four days before the party date. But it is not true in all countries. In other areas of the world, it may be considered foolish to make an appointment too far in advance because plans which are made for a date more than a week away tend to be forgotten. The meaning of time differs in different parts of the world. Thus, misunderstandings arise between people from different cultures that treat time differently. Promptness is valued highly in American life, for example. If people are not prompt, they may be regarded as impolite or not fully responsible.

Without preparing a very strong bid, a city will not win the competition to host the games. Beijing was chosen for the 2008 games from five bidders 一 Osaka, Paris, Toronto and Istanbul.\n  \n  Why does it take so long to prepare? \n  Building the infrastructure (基础设施) costs huge amounts of money. Holding the World Cup in 2002 in Japan and South Korea, for example, meant that ten new stadiums had to be built, as well as many hotels and an improved transport system. In Beijing, after winning the bid the government began major construction projects 一 the extension of the underground, the improvement of the airport and the building of new motorways. Each host city must also build an Olympic village for the athletes. By planting trees and creating parks, the city becomes more attractive for tourists.\n  \n  Why do countries want to host the Olympic Games?\n  Hosting the games has a major effect on the economy and brings international prestige(声望) to the country. Thousands and thousands of visitors come to the games and the host cities are permanently improved.  \n  `,\n    questions: [\n      {\n        question: `Bidding for the Olympic Games usually starts one year before the games are really held.`,\n        options: [\"T\", \"F\"],\n        answer: \"B\"\n      },\n      {\n        question: `Beijing was one of the five bidders for the 2008 games.`,\n        options: [\"T\", \"F\"],\n        answer: \"A\"\n      },\n      {\n        question: `The World Cup 2002 was held in China.`,\n        options: [\"T\", \"F\"],\n        answer: \"B\"\n      },\n      {\n        question: `Beijing started the improvement of the airport after winning the bid.`,\n        options: [\"T\", \"F\"],\n        answer: \"A\"\n      },\n      {\n        question: `Countries want to host the Olympic Games because it has a major effect on the economy.`,\n        options: [\"T\", \"F\"],\n        answer: \"A\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    text: `Taking away a city's rubbish is a big job. Every day trucks come into a city to collect it. Most rubbish is made up of things we can't eat or use. If we kept these things, we would soon have a mountain of rubbish.\n  In some cities the rubbish is collected and taken outside the city to a dump. Often the city dump is placed where the ground is low or there is a big hole. The kitchen rubbish is broken into small pieces and sent into the sewage(污水,排水)system. The sewage system takes away the used water from toilets, bathtubs and other places.\n  To keep mice and flies away, some earth is used to cover the newly dumped rubbish. Later, grass may be planted on the rubbish-filled land. Finally, a house or a school may be built there, and then you'd never know that this had once been an old rubbish dump.\n  In other cities the rubbish is burnt in special places. The fire burns everything except the metal.Sometimes the metal can be used again in factories where things are made of metal. The food parts of rubbish are put in special piles where they slowly change into something called humus(腐殖质), which looks like black earth. It is rich with the kinds of things that feed plants and help make them grow. `,\n    questions: [\n      {\n        question: `You can most probably read this kind of passage in a telephone book.`,\n        options: [\"T\", \"F\"],\n        answer: \"B\"\n      },\n      {\n        question: `The main idea of the passage is to tell people to take useful things out of rubbish.`,\n        options: [\"T\", \"F\"],\n        answer: \"B\"\n      },\n      {\n        question: `The underlined word \"sewage\" in the second paragraph means laundry.`,\n        options: [\"T\", \"F\"],\n        answer: \"B\"\n      },\n      {\n        question: `According to the passage, the food parts of rubbish can be used again to feed plants.`,\n        options: [\"T\", \"F\"],\n        answer: \"A\"\n      },\n      {\n        question: `We should take care of a used metal box by reusing and recycling it.`,\n        options: [\"T\", \"F\"],\n        answer: \"A\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    text: `A group of frogs were traveling through the woods, and two of them fell into a deep pit.

The other frogs kept telling them to stop, that they were as good as dead. Finally, one of the frogs took heed of(倾听) what the other frogs were saying and gave up.
