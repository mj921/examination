He didn't know what to do with himself. Although he read a lot of books and he went on holiday to interesting places with his wife, he was bored and befgan to get deperessed because he hated being retired.\nThen one day he saw an advertisement in the newspaper and, without telling his wife, he bought a small crockery (陶器) factory. The next week he told his family. They were horrified and worried. They thought he was too old at 71 to start work again.\nHe is now 76 and he has expanded the company considerably. He has increased the number of staff from 6 to 24 and he has found many new customers for the products. He has developed the export market and has improved profits by 200%. He has opened a new design office and enpolyed three young designers. They have been all over the world to ger new ideas, and one of them has gone to France this week to a major trade fair.

The answer is \"no\". It is not the tools a scientist uses but how he uses these tools that make him a scientist. You will probably agree that knowing how to use a power is important to a carpenter. You will probably agree, too, that knowing how to investigate, how to discover information, is important to everyone. The scientist, however, goes one step further, he must be sure that he has a reasonable answer to his questions and that his answer can be confirmed by other persons. He also works to fit the answer he gets to many questions into a large set of ideas about how the world works.\n\tThe scientist's knowledge must be exact. There is no room for half right or right just half the time. He must be as nearly right as the conditions permit. What works under one set of conditions at one time must work under the same conditions at other times. If the conditions are different, any changes the scientist observes in a demonstration must be explained by the changes in the conditions. This is one reason that investigations are important in science. Albert Einstein, who developed the theory of relativity, arrived at this theory through mathematics. The accuracy of this mathematics was later tested through investigations, Einstein's ideas were shown to be correct. A scientist uses many tools for measurements. Then the measurements are used to make mathematical calculations that may test his investigations.`,\n    questions: [\n      {\n        question: `What makes a scientist according to the passage? `,\n        options: [\n          \"The tools he uses.\t\t\t\t\t\",\n          \"The way he uses his tools. \",\n          \"His way of learning.\t\t\t\t\t\",\n          \"The various tools he uses.\"\n        ],\n        answer: \"B\"\n      },\n      {\n        question: `\"The scientist, however, goes one step further…\".

The goverment promised to pay some money for each dead rat. The made the people very happy. They killed thousands of rats everyday. A goverment officer put all the dead rats in a big pile.

One is invited to dinner at a home that is not only comfortably but even luxuriously(豪华地)furnished and in which there is every evidence of the fact the family has been able to afford foreign travel, expensive hobbies, and college education for the children; yet the hostess probably will cook the dinner herself, will serve it herself and will wash dishes afterward, furthermore the dinner will not consist merely of something quickly and easily assembled from contents of various cans and a cake or a pie bought at the nearby bakery.

Those sounds, whether spoken or written in letters, we call words.\n\tThe power of words, then, lies in their associations-the thing they bring up before our minds. Words become filled with meaning for us by experience; and the longer we live, the more certain words recall to us the glad and sad events of our past; and the more we read and learn, the more the number of words that mean something increases.\n\tGreat writers are those who not only have great thoughts but also express these thoughts in words which appeal powerfully to our minds and emotions. This charming and telling use of words is what we call literary style. Above all, the real poet is a master of words. He can convey his meaning in words which sing like music and which by their position and association can move men to tears.

Shy people are anxious and self-conscious; that is, they are excessively concerned with their own appearance and actions. Worrisome thoughts are constantly occurring in their minds: what kind of impression am I making? Do they like me? Do I sound stupid? Am I wearing unattractive clothes?\n\tIt is obvious that such uncomfortable feelings must negatively affect people. A person's conception of himself or herself is reflected in the way he or she behaves, and the way a person behaves affects other people's reactions. In general, the way people think about themselves has a profound effect on all areas of their lives.\n\tShy people, having low self-esteem, are likely to be passive and easily influenced by others. They need reassurance that they are doing \"the right thing.\" Shy people are very sensitive to criticism; they feel it confirms their feelings of inferiority. They also find it difficult to be pleased by compliment with a statement like this one, \"You're just saying that to make me feel good. I know it's not true.\" It is clear that while self-awareness is a healthy quality, overdoing it is harmful.\n\tCan shyness be completely eliminated, or at least reduced? Fortunately, people can overcome shyness with determined and patient efforts in building self-confidence. Since shyness goes hand in hand with a lack of self-esteems, it is important for people to accept their weakness as well as their strengths.\n\tEach one of us is a unique, worthwhile individual, interested in our own personal ways.

If you telephone him early in the day, while he is shaving or having breakfast, the time of the call shows that the matter is very important and requires immediate attention. The same meaning is attached to telephone calls made after 11:00 p.m. If someone receives a call during sleeping hours, he assumes it's a matter of life or death. The time chosen for the call communicates its importance. In social life, time plays a very important part. In the U.S.A. guests tend to feel they are not highly regarded if the invitation to a dinner party is extended only three or four days before the party date. But it is not true in all countries. In other areas of the world, it may be considered foolish to make an appointment too far in advance because plans which are made for a date more than a week away tend to be forgotten. The meaning of time differs in different parts of the world. Thus, misunderstandings arise between people from different cultures that treat time differently. Promptness is valued highly in American life, for example. If people are not prompt, they may be regarded as impolite or not fully responsible.

The systems that have been worked out resemble those used in spacecraft.`,\n    questions: [\n      {\n        options: [\n          \"field     \",\n          \"sources  \",\n          \"which  \",\n          \"precious  \",\n          \"amount \"\n        ],\n        answer: \"E\"\n      },\n      {\n        options: [\n          \"field     \",\n          \"sources  \",\n          \"which  \",\n          \"precious  \",\n          \"amount \"\n        ],\n        answer: \"B\"\n      },\n      {\n        options: [\n          \"field     \",\n          \"sources  \",\n          \"which  \",\n          \"precious  \",\n          \"amount \"\n        ],\n        answer: \"C\"\n      },\n      {\n        options: [\n          \"field     \",\n          \"sources  \",\n          \"which  \",\n          \"precious  \",\n          \"amount \"\n        ],\n        answer: \"D\"\n      },\n      {\n        options: [\n          \"field     \",\n          \"sources  \",\n          \"which  \",\n          \"precious  \",\n          \"amount \"\n        ],\n        answer: \"A\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n];\n","<template>\n  <div class=\"home\">\n    <van-nav-bar\n      title=\"英语\"\n      left-arrow\n      @click-left=\"$router.push('/mobile')\"\n      fixed\n      style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #efefef\"\n    />\n    <div class=\"score\" v-show=\"submit\">{{ score }} 分</div>\n    <div style=\"width: 100%;height: 50px;\"></div>\n    <div class=\"dx\">\n      <dl v-for=\"(item, i) in dxlist\" :key=\"i\">\n        <div class=\"question\">\n          <div class=\"no\">{{ i + 1 }}.</div>\n          <div\n            class=\"text\"\n            v-html=\"item.question.replace(/\\n/g, '<br/>')\"\n          ></div>\n          <span\n            v-show=\"submit\"\n            class=\"answer\"\n            :style=\"{\n              color: item.xx === item.answer ?
